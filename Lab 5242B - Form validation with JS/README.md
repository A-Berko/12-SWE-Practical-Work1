# Lab 5242B - Form validation with JavaScript

Create a webpage, as shown in figure validation.png.

The form must be validated: the name field cannot be empty, and the email ID must have at least one `@` symbol.

If the name field is empty, notify the user with an alert window. 

Change the colour of the label `Email:` in case an invalid email address is entered.
